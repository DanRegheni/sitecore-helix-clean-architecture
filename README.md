This is a sample implementation of the Clean Architecture Principles combined with Sitecore's Helix Architectura Design Principles.

# Motivation
The first goal would be to learn how to design modular applications by experimenting different architectural styles. 
Another goal is to provide a basic solution structure that can be used to develop well-factored, SOLID applications, using Sitecore Helix.

# Architectural Styles
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Onion Architecture
- Clean Architecture
- Sitecore Helix

 # Design Decisions and Dependencies
The goal of this sample is to provide a starter kit for new sitecore projects. It does not include every possible framework, tool, or feature that a particular enterprise application might benefit from. Its choices of technology for things like data access are rooted in what is the most common, accessible technology for most business software developers using Microsoft's ans Sitecore's technology stack.
